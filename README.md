## Features

- **Automated Appointment Checking:**  
  Reliably monitors the Munich registration office for available slots.
- **Dual Modes:**  
  Use either a command-line interface or a modern GUI ([`src/gui/main.py`](src/gui/main.py)).
- **Service-Ready:**  
  Deploy as a Windows service using [`ServiceWrapper`](src/ServiceWrapper.py).
- **Logging:**  
  Detailed logs are saved in the `logs/` directory for auditing and debugging.
- **Configurable:**  
  All major parameters (service/location IDs, target date, intervals) are easily adjustable in [`src/config.py`](src/config.py) and `settings.toml`.
- **Progress Feedback:**  
  CLI mode uses `tqdm` for progress bars; GUI mode displays real-time logs.

---


## Requirements

- **Python:** 3.11 or newer
- **OS:** Windows (service mode supported)
- **Dependencies:**  
  See [pyproject.toml](pyproject.toml) and [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) for all required packages.

---

## Setup

### 1. Command-Line Mode

```bat
run.bat
```

This script will:
1. Create a virtual environment.
2. Install dependencies.
3. Launch the CLI interface ([`src/Main.py`](src/Main.py)).

### 2. Graphical Mode

```bat
rungui.bat
```

This launches the GUI ([`src/gui/main.py`](src/gui/main.py)) for a visual experience.

---

## Usage

### CLI

- Edit configuration in [`src/config.py`](src/config.py) or `settings.toml` as needed.
- Run `run.bat` or `python src/Main.py`.

### GUI

- Run `rungui.bat` or `python src/gui/main.py`.
- The GUI displays logs and allows for easier monitoring.

---

## Configuration

You can configure the appointment checker using either [`src/config.py`](src/config.py) (for advanced users) or the user-friendly [`settings.toml`](settings.toml) file.

### Editing `settings.toml`

Open `settings.toml` and adjust the following parameters:

| Name              | Description                                                                                   | Example           |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|
| `SERVICE_ID`      | The unique ID for the service you want to book (e.g., registration, passport, etc.).         | `"10339027"`      |
| `LOCATION_ID`     | The unique ID for the office/location where you want the appointment.                        | `"10187259"`      |
| `TARGET_DATE`     | The specific date you want to book (format: `YYYY-MM-DD`). Leave empty to list all dates.    | `"2025-06-07"`    |
| `TIMEOUT`         | Maximum time (in seconds) to wait for web elements to load (Selenium explicit wait).         | `20`              |
| `BREAK_INTERVAL`  | Time (in seconds) to wait between each check for available appointments.                     | `5`               |
| `RESTART_INTERVAL`| Time (in seconds) after which the script will restart the browser session.                   | `35`              |
| `HEADLESS`        | Run browser in headless mode (`true` = no window, `false` = show browser window).            | `true`            |

#### Example

```toml
SERVICE_ID = "10339027"      # Service type (change to your desired service)
LOCATION_ID = "10187259"     # Location ID (change to your desired location)
TARGET_DATE = "2025-06-07"   # Target date (leave empty to list all available dates)
TIMEOUT = 20                 # Selenium explicit wait time (seconds)
BREAK_INTERVAL = 5           # Interval between checks (seconds)
RESTART_INTERVAL = 35        # Restart interval (seconds)
HEADLESS = true              # Run browser in headless mode (no window)
```

#### How to Use

1. Open `settings.toml` in a text editor.
2. Change the values as needed (see table above).
3. Save the file.
4. Run the program as usual (`run.bat`, `rungui.bat`, or directly with Python).

#### Advanced: Environment Variables

You can override any setting by exporting environment variables before running the program. For example:

```powershell
$env:DYNACONF_SERVICE_ID="your_service_id"
$env:DYNACONF_LOCATION_ID="your_location_id"
python src/Main.py
```

### Logging

- All logs are saved in the `logs/YYYY-MM-DD.log` file.
- Logs are also displayed in real-time in the GUI.

For more details on configuration, see comments in [`settings.toml`](settings.toml) and [`src/config.py`](src/config.py).
---

## Service Mode

Use [`ServiceWrapper`](src/ServiceWrapper.py) to install and manage this tool as a Windows service:

```bat
# Install the service
python ServiceWrapper.py install

# Start the service
python ServiceWrapper.py start

# Stop the service
python ServiceWrapper.py stop

# Uninstall the service
python ServiceWrapper.py remove
```

---

## Troubleshooting

- **No appointments found:**  
  Check your `SERVICE_ID`, `LOCATION_ID`, and `TARGET_DATE` in the config.
- **Webdriver errors:**  
  Ensure Chrome is installed and up to date.
- **Permission issues:**  
  Run as administrator if installing as a service.
- **Logs:**  
  Review logs in the `logs/` directory for error details.
